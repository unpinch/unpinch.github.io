Unpinch is the gesture for zooming-in - in our case into a long multi-hour episode and see the specific comments/annotations.
<br />
<br />
This gif showcases the timeline & the zoomline (which corresponds to the window on the timeline) and the comments shown below for the current window. The playback progress (cursor) is detached from the window so users can go forward to look at comments without disrupting their playback flow but could rewind/fast-forward if they wish. Comments behave the same way as in Reddit.
<br />
<br />
<b>This is very basic/crude and the final look will be more intuitive and simpler - for example we might have a single column of comments for the current window and the zoomline could be drawn as a funnel which starts from the window above it on the timeline.</b>

And here is the first fake with a waveform for the audio and annotations for the topics in the episode:
